That's a fantastic idea. A README serves as your mission statement and constant reminder of your goals and rules.

Here is a comprehensive README document for your 1.5-Month Python Foundation Bootcamp, ready to be copied into a file named `README.md` or a Word document.

# 🐍 1.5-Month Python Foundation Bootcamp (Nov 26, 2025 – Jan 10, 2026)

## 🎯 Mission Statement

To establish a deep, independent, and functional mastery of foundational Python programming. My goal is to move from relying on external tools (AI/ML) for basic logic to **internalizing core programming skills**, thereby preparing for advanced specialization in AI/ML/DL/DS.

**By the end of this bootcamp, I will be able to:**
1.  **Write Code Independently:** Create new code and implement non-trivial logic without referring to AI tools.
2.  **Read and Understand:** Analyze any given foundational Python script and fully grasp its function and flow.
3.  **Modify and Maintain:** Confidently debug, extend, and refactor existing Python code to meet new requirements.

## 🛑 The "No AI" Manifesto (Rules of Engagement)

This bootcamp is a strict test of self-reliance. Adherence to these rules is non-negotiable.

| Rule | Description | Instead, I will... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NO Generative AI** | ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, or similar code generation tools are **banned** for writing or debugging code. | Use the **Official Python Docs** and traditional search engines (Google/StackOverflow) specifically to look up syntax, error messages, or documentation, *not* full solutions. |
| **NO Copy/Paste** | Do not copy code snippets from tutorials or web pages directly into the editor. | Type all code manually to build muscle memory and recognize syntax errors immediately. |
| **Debug Manually** | When errors occur, read the traceback message carefully. | Use `print()` statements to trace variable values, understand scope, and manually pinpoint logic flaws. |

## 📅 Schedule Overview

* **Duration:** 45 Days (November 26, 2025 – January 10, 2026)
* **Time Commitment:** 4 hours per day.
* **Primary Resource:** [The Official Python 3 Documentation (Tutorial)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)

| Phase | Focus | Dates | Key Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Syntax & Control Flow** | Nov 26 – Dec 02 | Rock, Paper, Scissors Game |
| **2** | **Data Structures** | Dec 03 – Dec 09 | To-Do List Manager (List of Dictionaries) |
| **3** | **Functions & Modules** | Dec 10 – Dec 17 | Unit Converter Tool Library |
| **4** | **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** | Dec 18 – Dec 26 | Bank Account System (Class Hierarchy) |
| **5** | **File Handling & Logic** | Dec 27 – Jan 02 | Log File Analyzer (Reads/Writes Files) |
| **6** | **Capstone Project** | Jan 03 – Jan 10 | University Course Management System (CLI) |

## 📚 Tools and Environment

* **Language:** Python 3.10+
* **IDE/Editor:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
* **Practice Platforms:** HackerRank, LeetCode (for logic tasks only)

## ✅ Success Criteria

Each phase is considered complete only after the corresponding **Major Task/Project** is working correctly and the code has been reviewed by myself for **PEP 8** compliance (readability, style, and good variable names).

### **Final Project Goal (Jan 03 – Jan 10)**
The **University Course Management System** must demonstrate proficiency in:
* Data Persistence (Saving data to files).
* Object-Oriented Design (Classes and Inheritance).
* User Input Validation and Exception Handling (`try...except`).
* Modular Code Structure (Using functions and imports).

## 📈 Daily Workflow

1.  **Read (1 hr):** Study the assigned chapter/topic in the Official Docs or chosen resource.
2.  **Mini Task (1 hr):** Implement the simple, focused task for the day.
3.  **Practice/Refactor (1.5 hrs):** Work on the ongoing Phase Project, review previous day's code, or solve a LeetCode/HackerRank problem.
4.  **Review (0.5 hr):** Write a brief journal entry on what was hard, what was learned, and the biggest error encountered.

This README will be kept updated and will serve as my main navigational document for the next 45 days.
